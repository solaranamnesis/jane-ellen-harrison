# Delphika. --- A. The Erinyes. B. The Omphalos.

The material of the following paper falls conveniently under two headings, but the arguments respecting each are intimately connected, and cannot fairly be appreciated apart. It may be well, therefore, at the outset, to summarise briefly the conclusions at which I have arrived.

1\. The Erinyes at Delphi and elsewhere are primarily local ancestral ghosts. The conception of Homer, and in part of the tragedians, of the Erinyes as abstract, detached ministers of divine vengeance is comparatively late, and belongs rather to literature than to popular faith.

2\. The ghosts of important persons are conceived of as locally influential after death, and, being potent for good or evil, present a sort of neutral _fond_. In this neutral aspect they are [GREEK].

3\. This neutral _fond_ of [GREEK], _etc._, is probably from the first conceived of in its dual aspect. The ghosts are pleased or angry, white or black, Eumenides or Erinyes --- probably from the first the malignant aspect is somewhat uppermost.

4\. Among a people who bury their dead, ghosts are necessarily conceived of as demons of the earth, dwelling below the earth with only occasional emergence, and especially potent in all matters concerning the fertility and sterility of the earth. Hence the ritual for the dead and for chthonic divinities is practically identical.

5\. With the first dawn of anthropomorphism appears the notion that the earth is the mother, and the earth genii tend to be conceived of as her daughters. This notion is helped out by the fact that in primitive communities, agriculture, and thence the ritual attendant on it, is largely in the hands of women. Hence the sex of the Erinyes --- a monstrous anomaly when they are regarded as avengers of blood --- is naturally determined.

6\. The form in which these earth genii, these local ghosts, were primarily conceived as embodied was, among the primitive inhabitants of Italy and Greece, that of _snakes_; the woman-huntress, winged or wingless, of the tragedians was a later, complex development.

7\. The female _snake_-Erinys is intimately connected with the Delphic legend of the Python, and survives elsewhere in the worship of female divinities, _e. g._, Athene and Demeter; it is part of a wide-spread snake-cultus, whose last emergence is seen in the heretical sect of the Ophites.

8\. The primitive haunt and sanctuary of the Erinyes was the omphalos.

9\. The omphalos was primarily a grave surmounted by a fetich stone, the centre of a cultus of ghosts and earth genii, whose worship, in later, anthropomorphic days, developed into that of Gaia, Kronos and other kindred divinities.

10\. By Homer's time this old cult of ghost and fetich, of Gaia-Kronos, had been overlaid by the incoming, dominant cult of Zeus and Apollo.* The result was manifold; the real meaning of the ghost-Erinyes was eclipsed, though never wholly lost, the malignant side over-emphasised, the conception delocalised, and with this delocalisation the snake form and connection with the grave-omphalos almost wholly obscured.

*) In the matter of the stratification of cults, and especially of the racial affinity of Zeus, Apollo and Artemis, I owe much mythological light to the views, published and unpublished, of Prof. Ridgeway. His position, sketched out in the article 'What people produced the objects called Mycenean?' (_J. H. S._ 16. 76), has been further developed in his professorial lectures at Cambridge, which I have had the privilege of attending, and will, it is hoped, shortly be stated in full in his forthcoming work on prehistoric Greece.

11\. In the _Choephoroi_ of Aeschylus, dealing as it does with the ritual of the grave, there is necessarily a literary resurgence of primitive conceptions. In the _Eumenides_ the conflict of new and old is embodied, and so skilful is the illusion, that it was possible in a play acted at Athens to represent the Erinyes as immigrant strangers of hideous and unknown form, unrecognised by the local Delphic priestess. By a still more remarkable inversion of fact, it was possible to convince an Athenian audience that these Erinyes of the literary imagination were transformed into the local Semnae, these local Semnae being, in fact, the very order of beings from whom the literary Erinyes themselves sprang.

# A. The Erinyes.

Incertus Geniumne loci famulumne parentis  Esse putet. --- Verg. Aen. v. 95.

It will be obvious to any one conversant with the subject that in two of the steps of my argument I lay no claim to originality. In his remarkable _Dissertations on the Eumenides_ (2nd edition, English, 1853, p. 155) C. O. Müller states distinctly that the Erinyes 'were neither more nor less than a particular form of the great goddesses who rule the earth and the lower world and send up the blessings of the year, namely Demeter and Cora.' This doctrine, with some modification and amplification, is substantially that of my Clause 5.

I owe a still more important and fundamental debt to Dr. Erwin Rohde. The main theory of his book, _Psyche_, I believe to be mistaken; it is none the less full of priceless incidental suggestion. He says of the Erinyes (_Psyche_, p. 247) 'Nur philosophisch-dichterisch Reflexion hat sie zu Helfern alles Rechtes in Himmel und auf Erden umgebildet. Im Cultus und begrenzten Glauben der einzelnen Stadt bleiben sie Beistände der Seelen Ermordeter... Und sieht man genau hin, so schimmert noch durch die getrübte Überlieferung eine Spur davon durch, dass die Erinys eines Ermordeten nichts anderes war als seine eigene zürnende, sich selbst ihre Rache holende Seele, die erst in spaterer Umbildung zu einem den Zorn der Seele vertretenden Höllengeist geworden ist.' This view Dr. Rohde himself confirms and amplifies in his 'Paralipomena' (_Rhein. Mus._ 1895, p. 22), Dieterich (_Nekuia_, p. 55) confirms it, and Otto Crusius (Roscher, _Lex._ 2. 1163) in his article 'Keren' says 'Die [GREEK] sind die zürnenden Seelen.' In fact, no serious mythologist* now controverts this position.

*) I cannot include in this category the author of the article 'Erinys' in Roscher's _Lexicon._ According to him the attributes and functions of the Erinys are to be derived from the 'in Blitz und Donner sich entladende Gewitterwolke.' They are [GREEK] and they carry things away, therefore they are 'das Bild der ungestüm dabeifahrenden dunklen Wetterwolke' --- by parity of reasoning they might be
black cats.

This fundamental truth, that the Erinyes are angry souls, would doubtless have been recognised long ago but for a certain topsy-turvydom of method which has, until quite recent years, infected all mythological research. 'In the Homeric poems we find ourselves at the starting-point of all that has given Greece her place in the world, of Greek history, of Greek art, of Greek philosophy, theology and myth.' The statement, true of the one item omitted --- literature, is profoundly false of all the rest; the spade has revealed to us strata underlying the civilization out of which the Homeric poems sprang. For theology and myth, our only concern here, Homer represents a complex adjustment and achievement, an almost mechanical accomplishment, with scarcely a hint of _origines_. But in England, where scholarship is mainly literary, the doctrine that Homer is the beginning of the Greek world is likely to die hard. Its death may possibly be eased and hastened by the story of the Erinyes.

With respect, then, to the first three clauses ot my argument, I may refer to the articles by Rohde and Crusius; they have collected ample and more than ample evidence to prove that the functions and ritual of the dead and of the beings variously called Potniae, Semnae, Eumenides, Erinyes, Praxidikae, Maniae, _etc._, were originally and fundamentally identical. One or two points, however, in connection with this require to be further elucidated or emphasised.

First, as regards the number of the Erinyes. In Homer they appear usually in the plural --- _e. g._ _Od._ 11. 280, [GREEK]. If we keep to the idea of ghosts, we must translate the 'angry ghosts of a mother.' Each mother had of course originally only one ghost, but in Homer's late conception the individual ghosts, each one of which only avenged himself, have been abstracted into a sort of body corporate of avengers, all of whom pursued each offender. The final step of the abstraction is to make of the Erinys a sort of personified conscience, but all this is remote from the manner of primitive thought. It is interesting to see that the tragedians, who are often far more local and primitive than Homer, frequently employ the singular and realise that each dead man has his own separate Erinys.

[GREEK]. --- Aesch. _Sept._ v. 975.

Here the Erinys is surely in apposition to the [GREEK], the [GREEK] of the dead man. The passage is an instructive _contaminatio_ of two radically different conceptions, the Homeric phantom shadow idea and the powerful local ancestral ghost. The notion of the single Erinys also lurks in the _Eumenides_ of Aeschylus. Aeschylus, of course, has a chorus of Eumenides, the [GREEK], and he doubtless conceived of them as indefinitely and Homerically plural, but they are roused from their sleep by Clytemnestra, the _one_ real Erinys.

Another point remains to be emphasised. It is easy enough even to the modern mind to realise that the Erinys was primarily the angry ghost, and a ghost is never so angry as when he has been murdered. The counterface of the picture is less obvious, _i. e._ the idea that the ghost of the dead man when content is a power that makes for fertility, the chief good to primitive man. The farmer of ancient days had to reckon with his dead ancestors, and was scrupulous to obey the precept _de mortuis nil nisi bene_. Hippocrates ([GREEK] 2. p. 14) tells us that if anyone saw the dead in a dream dressed in white, and giving something, it was a good omen, [GREEK]. It is this, the good, white side of the ghosts that was suppressed in the Homeric Erinys, but which reemerged at once when they, the Erinyes of Aeschylus, were allowed to become their real selves, _i. e._ the Semnae, potent alike for fertility and sterility. To the priestess in the _Eumenides_ they appear [GREEK], but Athene knows better; she knows that they are practically Moirae, with control over all human weal and woe.

[GREEK]. --- Aesch. _Eum._ 930.

Primitive daemons, it may be observed in passing, are apt to be gods of all work, later they differentiate off into black and white, friendly and hostile, and finally develop a complete departmentalism.

One salient instance of the primitive dual character of the Erinyes is of special value because it is connected with a definite ritual practice. Just seven furlongs out of Megalopolis on the Messene road there was a sanctuary, Pausanias (8. 34, 3) said, of certain goddesses ([GREEK]). Pausanias himself is evidently not sure who and what they are. 'And they call both the goddesses themselves and the district round the sanctuary by the name of Maniae' (Madnesses) --- he suggests however that the name may be a 'title of the Eumenides'; ([GREEK]) --- 'and they say that here Orestes went mad after the murder of his mother.' He then describes a monument called the monument of Daktylos or Finger. To this I shall return later under the heading 'Omphalos.' 'Here too,' Pausanias says, ' there is a sanctuary to the Eumenides --- they say that when these goddesses were going to drive Orestes out of his senses they appeared to him black, but when he had bitten off his finger they appeared again to him as white, and he became sane at the sight, and thus [GREEK].' We have no convenient word to render the difference between [GREEK] and [GREEK] but the distinction is important; [GREEK] is said of the ritual of dead heroes, and of chthonic divinities, the sacrifice is offered on or poured into the ground, it goes _down_ --- [GREEK] strictly is confined to the ritual of the Olympian gods, the sacrifice is burnt, it goes _up_. Here the old ghosts have divided off into Maniae (_i. e._ obviously Erinyes-Furies) and Eumenides, and the Eumenides side has got Olympianised. This is made the clearer by the last and most remarkable statement of Pausanias, 'Along with these (_i. e._ [GREEK]) it is customary to sacrifice ([GREEK]) to the Charites,' _i. e._ practically the white side of the ghosts; the Eumenides are the same as the Charites, the givers of all increase. To examine in detail the cult of the Charites would take us too far; it may at first be something of a shock to find that the Charites are practically only the white beneficent side of the Erinyes, but this passes when we remember that at Orchomenos, the most ancient seat of their worship, where their images were mere crude stones, they were worshipped at night, and like all chthonic divinities with the offering of the honey cake. They were also a sort of Moirae; the lucky throw at dice was called [GREEK].

The connection of the Moirae with the ghost Erinyes we have already noted. Here again cultus came in to strengthen the argument by analogy of ritual between the Moirae, Semnae and Eumenides. Pausanias mentions at Titane (2. 11 4), 'a grove of evergreen oaks and a temple of the goddesses whom the Athenians call venerable (Semnae) and the Sicyonians name Eumenides (kindly). On one day every year they celebrate a festival in their honour at which they sacrifice a sheep with young, and pour libations of honey mixed with water and use flowers instead of wreaths.' The sheep with young clearly points to the goddesses of fertility and the absence of wreaths is curiously paralleled in the cult of the Charites at Paros. Apollodorus p. 3, 15, 7, after telling the story of Minos and Androgeos, says [GREEK]. At Titane Pausanias goes on to tell us they perform the like ceremonies ([GREEK]) at the altar of the Fates --- it stands in the grove under the open sky. In this important passage we have the Semnae identified with the Eumenides and their ritual with that of the Moirae. This identity of ritual is paralleled by identity of function. When Prometheus is asked who guides the rudder of Fate he answers (Aesch. _Prom._ 515).

[GREEK].

Nay more in the Eumenides they are the [GREEK] (_Eum._ 172). Just in the same way the [GREEK], the souls, are fates, and as such essentially [GREEK] as in Hes. _Theog._ 217.

[GREEK]

though with Hesiod, never too optimistic in his view, the [GREEK] incline to the black side (v. 211).

[GREEK].

The idea of a ghost, a double, a fate shadowing a man in his life and powerful to affect his descendants after death is common to many primitive peoples. It depends on the temper of the people whether the ghost is regarded as benevolent or malignant, white or black. The West African tribes according to Miss Kingsley have their Eumenides. 'In almost all West African districts' (_West African Studies_, p. 132) 'is a class of spirits called "the well-disposed ones" and this class is clearly differentiated from "them" the generic term for non-human spirits. These well-disposed ones are ancestors, and they do what they can to benefit their particular village or family Fetish, who is not a human spirit nor an ancestor. But the things given to ancestors are gifts not in the proper sense of the word sacrifices, for the well-disposed ones are not gods, even of the rank of a Sasabonsum or an Omburiri' --- here we seem to catch a god arrested in the process of making. The Erinyes of the West African are not angry ancestors, but the ghosts of enemies who are regarded as malevolent --- 'To insult or neglect' the 'well-disposed ones,' is rude and disreputable, but it will not bring on _e. g._ an outbreak of small pox. African missionaries have found that the nearest equivalent to the word God in our Scriptures is the word 'Mulungu' the general native term for spirit. The spirit of the deceased man is called his Mulungu and all the offerings of the living are presented to such spirits of the dead. 'It is here that we find the great centre of the native religion. The spirits of the dead are the gods of the living.' (Duff MacDonald, _Africana_, 1882, vol. 1. p. 59). As regards the black and white Maniae Mr. Frazer says in his commentary (citing Callaway), 'The Zulus believe that there are black spirits (Itongos) and white spirits; the black spirits cause disease and suffering, but the white spirits are beneficent. The Yakuts think that bad men after death become dark ghosts, but good men become bright ones.' (Paus. 8. 34, 3, Com.)

I have long thought that in the white beneficent aspect of the Eumenides lies the explanation of the much disputed 'white maidens.' When the Gauls were approaching Delphi the oracle vouchsafed to the anxious inhabitants ran as follows: 'I and the white maidens will care for these things.'

[GREEK].

It is generally held that the white maidens are Artemis and Athene, but this view only rests on the opinion of Diodorus (22. 9. 5). Surely it is far more probable that in a moment of extreme peril there should be a resurgence of the ancient deities of the place, deities half forgotten perhaps by the educated supreme always in the hearts of the vulgar. At Delphi there was no need and anyhow it was safer not to name the [GREEK].

Badness and blackness are synonymous. To-day we talk of a black story, and the black man of the chimney still survives. Callimachos in his charming fashion tells us how Olympian mothers, when one of the baby goddesses was naughty, would call for a Cyclops to come, and Hermes blacked himself with coal and played the hobgoblin.

[GREEK] --- _Callim. Dian._ 68.

There is a splendid instance of the hero-bogey gone black in Pausanias 6. 6. 4. [GREEK] as he appeared in his picture was [GREEK]. This goes along with the growing feeling that dead heroes were apt to be hostile and their graves must be passed with precautions of silence lest they should be annoyed and show it. Hesych. _sub voc._ [GREEK] says: [GREEK].

At this point a word is necessary as to the etymology of the word Erinyes; after what has been said it can scarcely be doubted that the account in Pausanias is correct. In discussing the Thelpusa cult of Demeter Erinys-Lusia (8. 25. 4) --- to which I shall return later --- he says [GREEK]. The contrast between the Erinys and Lusia of the Thelpusian cult is precisely the same as that between the Black and White Maniae of Megalopolis. Whatever be the precise etymology of Erinyes we are evidently in that primitive stage of things when the names of spirits and daemons are not names proper but attributive epithets. We are very near the West African to whom the spirits are 'them,' and 'them' may be kindly (Eumenides), angry (Erinyes), venerable (Semnae), grace-giving (Charites), awful (Potniae), mad ones (Maniae), vengeful (Praxidikae). We have not yet reached the point where personality is clearly outlined. Our imagination is so possessed by figures like the Olympian gods, sharply defined, real, actual, personal, that it is only by considerable mental effort that we realise the fact --- all important for the study of mythology --- that _there are no gods at all_, no objective facts; that what we are investigating are only conceptions of the human mind constantly shifting with every human mind that conceives them. Art which makes the image, literature crystallising attributes and functions, arrest and fix this shifting kaleidoscope. Until the coming of art and literature, and to some extent after, [GREEK]. There is no greater bar to the understanding of mythology than our modern habit of clear analytic thought; the first necessity is that by an imaginative effort we should think back the [GREEK] we have so sharply divided into the haze of the primitive [GREEK].

If the first step in the making of a god is the attribution of human quality, the attribution of sex will not tarry long. Mother-Earth is a conception too wide-spread to need comment. Father-Land is a late and monstrous patriarchalism. The Cretans, often true to primitive tradition, still said [GREEK], when the rest of Greece said [GREEK] ([GREEK]. Plut. an seni sit ger. resp. 17.). It is to [GREEK] that the Danaides appeal in their supreme peril. This point need not be laboured, but it is worth noting that the sex of the earth and of divinities connected with the earth, like the Eumenides, must have been confirmed by, if it did not originate in, the connection between women and agriculture in primitive days. Mr. Payne in his _History of the New World_ (vol. 2. p. 7 and 8), observes that formerly women were the only industrial class; men were engaged in hunting, fishing, fighting. "Agriculture," he says, "was originally based on the servitude of women. Primitive man refuses to interfere in agriculture; he thinks it magically dependent for success on woman and connected with child-bearing. 'When the women plant maize,' said the Indian to Gumilla, 'the stalk produces two or three ears. Why? Because women know how to produce children. They only know how to plant the corn so as to ensure its germinating. Then let them plant it; they know more than we know'." Thus it is easy to see how the Eumenides-Erinyes, spirits of fertility or sterility, came to be regarded as daughters of mother earth, whereas it is hard to conceive of any state of society so matriarchalised as to make its avengers of blood of the female sex. Aeschylus, who is anxious not to allow the fertility aspect of the Eumenides to appear prematurely, makes them, when formally questioned by Athene, say they are daughters of Night, [GREEK] (Eum. 416).

but Hesiod (_Theog._ 184) long before made them daughters of Earth. Sophocles compromises; with him they are [GREEK]. (_Oed. Col._ 40.)

I have noted already the dualism of black and white, curse and blessing; it is curious to see how this other anthropomorphic dualism of mother and daughter fits in with it. When it comes to dividing up functions between mother and daughter, the daughter gets the stern side, the maiden is naturally a little _farouche_. This Aeschylus turns to admirable polemical account in his [GREEK].

At this point the full significance of C. O. Müller's statement becomes apparent, _i. e._ that the Erinyes were neither more nor less than a particular form of the great goddesses who rule the earth and the lower world, _i. e._ Demeter and Kore. This statement inverted would be, to my mind, a just presentment of the order of development. Demeter and Kore, mother and maid, are perfectly anthropomorphised, idealised forms of those vague apparitions, the earth and the spirits of the earth. In this connection it must never be forgotten that Demeter herself is also Erinys, also Melaina, the earth goddess, as well as the earth spirits has the black as well as white aspect, though in later days the dark side of the functions went over to Kore. I do not dwell on the cult of Demeter Erinys, for its importance has been abundantly emphasised by all writers from C. O. Müller downwards. And not only were the Erinyes forms of Demeter, but the dead, Plutarch says, were in old days called by the Athenians Demeter's people, [GREEK] (Plut. de fac. in orb. lun., 28, p. 943).

In order clearly to establish the double black and white aspect of the earth spirits, I have passed rather prematurely on to their complete anthropomorphic development, and must go back to the proposition of the 6th clause, _i. e._ that the form in which these local genii were at first embodied was that of _snakes_.

This snake form brings together the views of C. O. Müller and Rohde; it is a connecting link between ancestral ghosts and earth genii, and it is strange that neither of these writers perceived what would have been his strongest argument.

To say that in their primary form the Erinyes were thought of as embodied in snakes may seem at first sight so startling that it may be well to call attention at the outset to the fact that the idea is no wise foreign to the tragedians.

When Clytemnestra hears the snoring of the Furies how does she name them?

[GREEK].

Travail and sleep, chartered conspirators,  Have spent the fell rage of the _dragoness_ (v. 126).

Of course it is possible to say that she uses the term [GREEK] 'poetically' for a monster, but the fact remains that she calls the chorus _a dragoness_, when she might quite naturally have called them hounds, as indeed in the next lines she frankly proceeds to do. It would really have been more 'poetical' to preserve the metaphor intact. The passage does not stand alone. To Euripides also a Fury is a [GREEK].

[GREEK]; (_Iph. Taur._ 286 f.)

Here it may perhaps be urged that the conception is borrowed from Aeschylus, but the stage Furies of Aeschylus were certainly _not [GREEK]_ and also the [GREEK] confuses the effect of the [GREEK] that follow. In the _Orestes_ also (v. 256) the Furies are [GREEK] and it is surely putting a strain on language to say this means they have snakes in their hands or hair. But the crowning literary illustration on this point is Clytemnestra's dream in the _Choephoroi_. Clytemnestra dreams that she gives birth to and suckles a snake, Dr. Verrall has pointed out (v. 39-41 and 925-927) that the snake was the regular symbol of things subterranean and especially of the grave, and he conjectures that the snake was presented to the minds of the audience by the 'visible grave of Agamemnon, which would presumably be marked as a tomb in the usual way.' This is most true and absolutely essential to the understanding of the play, in fact its keynote, but the snake is more than the symbol of the dead, it is the vehicle of the Erinys, and the Erinys is Orestes, (v. 547):

[GREEK],

not merely 'deadly as a serpent,' but as a 'serpent Erinys.' The meaning is obscured to us in two ways; conventionally and traditionally we have come to regard the Erinyes as the pursuers of Orestes, whereas here he, as Erinys, pursues. Moreover the Erinyes are naturally as we have seen female; here by command of the patriarchal Apollo comes the male Erinys. The Erinys was a snake and also as we have abundantly seen a Fate; it is only when the two notions are firmly grasped that the full meaning of Orestes' words appear. Clytemnestra cries for mercy in vain (v. 925):

[GREEK].  Nay, for my father's _fate hisses_ thy death.

The snake form of the Erinys comes out more clearly perhaps in art than in literature. Snakes of course, as the conventional decoration of either [GREEK] or [GREEK], abound on vase paintings; good examples are the [GREEK] of Patroklos (Brit. Mus. Cat. B 239), and the [GREEK] in the funeral scene on the kantharos in the Bibliothèque Nationale (Miliet-Giraudon, 38). Both [GREEK] and [GREEK] are painted white, the snake being black; the white is probably in a sense prophylactic to warn the passer-by that the place was taboo. More instructive for our purpose are the instances in which a live snake or snakes issue out of the [GREEK] to protect it from desecration or to receive offerings made by the survivors. On a white lekythos at Athens (_Jahrbuch_, 1891, Taf. 4) we have a case in point. From a white grave tumulus, a [GREEK], issue forth two large angry-looking snakes; they are about to pursue a youth who flies away in fright. He has no doubt accidentally or intentionally violated the tomb, and they are the avenging Erinyes. In a case like this we might share the doubt of Aeneas, but in the next instance the Erinys' aspect is beyond doubt.

On a Tyrrhenian amphora in the Bourguignon Coll., Orvieto, Fig. 1 (_Jahrbuch_, 1893, p. 93), we have a curious and very interesting representation of the slaying of Polyxena. Lying absolutely over the very tomb of Achilles is the body of Polyxena, her blood just shed on the altar-tomb by Neoptolemos; the tomb is [GREEK], and even has the covering network of fillets. To this point I shall return later; for the present the important point is, that out of the [GREEK] arises a great live snake. Obviously the idea is that the ghost of Achilles in snake form rises up, an Erinys, asking and receiving the atoning blood. But even in this vase there is the incipient confusion, or rather blending of ideas, for Neoptolemos flies affrighted --- the snake is the offended _genius loci_ as well as the satisfied hero-ghost. Here is indeed mythology in the making, the notion shifts and flickers. Either the snake is the actual vehicle of the ghost of the dead man, _is_ the dead man; or he is the guardian, the familiar spirit of the dead man, the famulus as in the account of Scipio's grave (_Plin. N. H._ 16. 85): subest specus, in quo manes ejus custodire draco traditur; or he is merely the earth daemon: nullus locus sine genio est qui per anguem plerumque ostenditur (Serv. ad. Verg. _Aen._ v. 85). The snake is [GREEK], native child of the earth as opposed to the horse, the enemy and stranger; so was the portent explained that appeared to Croesus (_Herod_ 1. 78). Of these conceptions the _genius loci_ is most familiar to us, appearing constantly as it does in Latin poets, but the idea of the serpent as the vehicle of the hero is thoroughly Greek, and belongs to the stratum of [GREEK] obscured to us by Homer --- [GREEK] (Plut. _Cleom._ 39). When the people saw the great snake winding round the impaled body of Cleomenes they knew that he was a hero. Again, the scholiast on the _Plutus_ of Aristophanes (v. 733) says [GREEK]. Perhaps, most instructive of all is the expression Photius records, the 'speckled hero' (Photius, _Lex._ s. v.) [GREEK].

As in the case of the ghost-Erinyes, so here we are not without savage analogies. At Blantyre, in East Central Africa, 'a spirit often appears as a serpent. When a man kills a serpent thus belonging to a spirit he goes and makes an apology to the offended god, saying "please, I did not know it was your serpent."' Here the serpent is perhaps rather the familiar of the god, but if a dead man wants to frighten his wife he is apt to present himself in the form of a serpent. Ghost and god are not far asunder (_Africana_, Duff-MacDonald, 1882, Vol. 1. p. 63). Again (p. 161), it is noted of the Gallas, an African tribe, that they have no idols, but revere sacred objects and animals, serpents especially being sacred. One variety of snake they regard as having been the mother of the human family.

M. Henry Jumod, in his interesting account of the Barongas (_Les Barongas_, p. 396), notes that among this people the snake is regarded as a sort of incarnation of an ancestor, and is somewhat dreaded, but never worshipped. A native, pursuing a snake that had got into the kitchen of a missionary station, accidentally set the building on fire. All the neighbours exclaimed that the fire was due to the snake, and the snake was the _chikonembo_ or ghost of a man who was buried close at hand, and who had come out of the earth to avenge himself. M. Jumod adds cautiously: 'Que les reptiles du bois sacré et les petits serpents bleus soient envisagés comme des incarnations temporaines des chiko nembo c'est probable... De cette constatation à la supposition que ces animaux sont des messagers ou des incarnations transitoires des Dieux il n'y a qu'un pas. Mais jamais ils n'ont pas songé à adorer un serpent.' This is clear from the fact that a free thinker among them will occasionally kill a serpent because he is bored by the too frequent reappearance of his ancestor, and as he kills it will say, 'Come, now, we have had enough of you.'

It is only necessary to recall the frequent mythological appearance of the hero as snake, _e. g._ Erichthonios and Kychreus, and perhaps most noticeable of all the case of Sosipolis, the child who turned into a snake (P. 6. 20, 213). Sosipolis had a sanctuary where the snake disappeared into the ground --- he also had the offering of the honey-cake and water for libation, the [GREEK] and the [GREEK]. To the modern Greek peasant his child till baptized is a [GREEK], and no doubt in danger of disappearing in that form; the line between animal and human is no wise clearly drawn. As every one knows, the Erinyes in their conventional art-form from the fifth century B. C. downwards are represented as maidens brandishing snakes in their hands. It was this fact that gave me the clue to the primary snake form of the Erinyes. A god or goddess is apt to hold in his hand or keep by his side the animal form he has outgrown.

But it may fairly be asked, can the connecting link in the chain be shown? We have the complete anthropomorphic form and we have the snake form; can the transition stage be shown, the customary halfway house of half-human, half-animal form? Erichthonios of course, the snake child, became half-snake, half-man. Cecrops appears on many a monument as the snake-tailed hero. Malevolent monsters like the Echidna, Typhon and the like are snake-tailed, so in late art are the earth-born giants. But all these are somewhat remote analogies. Have we any snake-tailed women genii of the earth, of fertility or sterility, that we can fairly adduce? A recently published vase (Böhlau, 'Schlangenleibige Nymphen,' _Philolog._ 57. NF 11. 1) supplies the missing link. One side of the design is reproduced in Fig. 2. As Dr. Böhlau has pointed out,* the two sides of the vase are definitely contrasted. On the one side we have the destroyers of the vine, the goats, on the other its nurturers, snake-bodied nymphs, veritable Eumenides. The vase is specially important because our modern minds, haunted by the tradition of the malevolent 'old serpent,' have some difficulty in realizing the snake as the good genius. These kindly grape-gathering, flute-playing, snake-nymphs give us a picture of peace and plenty and beneficence not easily forgotten, they are veritable snake-Charites, a cup might fitly be reserved for them at the banquet; they are [GREEK] meet to be daughters of Ophion and Eurynome, the fish-tailed goddess whose sanctuary in Phigaleia was [GREEK]* (Paus. 8. 41. 6, Hes. _Theog._ 908).

*) I venture to differ from Dr. Böhlau on one small but important detail. The object carried on the right arm of one of the snake-nymphs is, I believe, _not_ a shield but a basket of the shape ordinarily in use among the Greeks for agricultural purposes. On a vase published by Salzmann (_Necropole_, Pl. 54, Figs. 2 and 3) a sower who follows a team of oxen ploughing holds on his arm a basket precisely similar. It evidently holds the seed he is scattering.

*) For a remarkable parallel to Eurynome see Mr. E. J. Payne (_History of the New World_, vol. 1. p. 453). The female Dagon or Oceanus of the New World was the goddess of a lake worshipped as mamacota or mother-water, because she furnished the nation with fish for food. She had the body of a fish surmounted by a rude human head. Her worship could only be abolished by the substitution of an image of the Virgin. At no great distance was worshipped also another embodiment of the lake, a figure enwreathed by serpents.

[Fig. 2. --- Serpent-bodied Nymphs. (_Philologus_, N. F. 11.)]()

Own daughters to the [GREEK] of the vase are the kindly Eumenides of the well-known Argos relief (_Mitt. d. Inst. Ath._ 4. 176, Roscher, _Lex._ 1330). In the one hand they hold flowers, in the other snakes --- there is 'nothing terrible' in their aspect; they are gracious to the man and woman who approach as suppliants --- the snake is not the weapon of terror but merely the symbol, as the flowers are, of the fertility of the earth. It was only when the meaning of the snake was obscured that it became a terror.

The Argos Eumenides relief belongs to the well-known type or the trinity of female goddesses which have long presented a somewhat confused problem to archaeologists. Familiar examples of this type are the Thasos relief where on one side are Apollo and three Nymphs, on the other Hermes and three Charites (Rayet, _Monuments de l'Art Antique; Bas-reliefs de Thasos_). But for the inscription Charites and Nymphs would be indistinguishable. In the Megara relief, at Berlin (_Mythology and Mon. of Athens_, p. 546, Fig. 8.), Hermes leads three dancing women in the cave of Pan; discussion is endless as to whether they are Nymphs, Charites, Cecropidae or Horae. Where there is no inscription, the question is best left unresolved. All are the same at bottom, _i. e._ they are three [GREEK]. Nymph is nothing but marriageable maiden, and Charites is but one of the many [GREEK] (Iambl. _Vit. Pyth._ 56). The passage is notable not for the purpose of evidencing, as Pythagoras intended, the piety of woman, but as showing that attention is already drawn to the anthropomorphic habit of reflecting, in the names of the gods, the various human relationships of their worshippers; at bottom these Horae, Nymphae, Charites, Eumenides are nothing but [GREEK] maidens. In this connection the relief given in Fig. 3 from the collection Tyszkiewicz is instructive. The inscription runs: [GREEK] --- with [GREEK] understood --- Sotias dedicated the [GREEK]. We have the three familiar maidens with fruit and flowers, as yet unadorned by any [GREEK] --- we have as it were the root idea from which the anthropomorphic form of Charites, Horae, Cecropidae, Nymphae, Eumenides, Semnae sprang. In discussing the origin of the myth of the Judgment of Paris I long ago tried to show (_J. H. S._ 1886, p. 217) that the rival goddesses Hera, Athene, and Aphrodite were only the three Charites or gift-givers at strife --- they are the vague [GREEK] completely differentiated and departmentalized, but art represents them frequently without distinctive attributes (see _J. H. S. loc. cit._ Plate 70.).

[Fig. 3. --- Votive Relief, Coll. Tyszkiewicz. (Fröhner, Pl. 16.)]()

It may well be asked: why the trinity? If plurality began in Mother and Daughter, Demeter and Kore, why not mere duality? I am not sure that I can answer the question. Something was due no doubt to the artistic convenience of three; three makes a good group. The number was not canonical in early days, witness the constant discussion about the number of the Horae; possibly also when the Mother and Daughter had become thoroughly two there was a natural tendency to give to the new-made couple a mother, and thus create a trinity. It is curious that in the ancient Greek world the male trinity is wholly absent. Possibly also the seasons, first two and then three, added strength to the notion. I would make a final suggestion. In the curious Boeotian relief vase, [GREEK]. 1892, [GREEK]. 9, we have the great Earth mother, the [GREEK], figured with two women supporters, one at either side. It does not seem necessary to suppose they are di nixi. This looks like the origin of the trinity, which must have been originally not 3 but 1 + 2.

[Fig. 4. --- Design from Prothesis Vase.]()

We have now to return to the Argos relief. We have reached the anthropomorphic form of the Erinys; the snake remains, but only as an attribute, held in the hand. This is perhaps the best place in which to note some other elements that contributed to the formation of the art type of the Erinys.

The first element to be noted is the [GREEK]. The primitive inhabitant of Greece, whom for convenience sake we call Pelasgian, buried his dead and thought of the dead hero as a snakegenius dwelling in the ground. The Achaean of Homer burned his dead and believed that nothing remained except the dim and strengthless ghost, the [GREEK]. The [GREEK] was a little _winged_ fluttering thing --- a feeble [GREEK] of the living man. The two forms are admirably seen and contaminated in the design of an archaic prothesis vase, Fig. 4 (_Ath. Mitt._, 16. 379); in a grave tumulus are seen a large curled snake, and above him four fluttering [GREEK]. Similar little winged figures are figured on the remarkable lekythos in the Jena Museum (Schadow, _Eine Attische Grablekythos_, Jena, 1897), where the winged souls, or [GREEK], are issuing from and returning to a large sepulchral pithos. This _winged_ type of the soul, this Homeric [GREEK], contributed, I have no doubt, to supply the Erinyes with wings. Further, when the Homeric imagination had transformed the Erinys from an angry ghost into a messenger of justice, wings were doubly necessary. A winged form was not far to seek. The Gorgon type was ready to hand, and suited admirably the bogey nature of the angry ghost. Such a form we have in Fig. 5 from a black-figured amphora in the Museo Gregoriano of the Vatican. The instance is the more instructive, as the artist does not entirely trust the Erinys type he has adopted. That his meaning may not miscarry _he adds the original Erinys_, _i. e. the snake_.

[Fig. 5. --- From B. F. Amphora. (Passerius, _Pict. Etrusc. 3. 297).]()

In the later Erinys form, _i. e._ the typical 'Fury' of Hades in short chiton and hunting boots, another element enters of unmistakable import, _i. e._ the art-type of the goddess Artemis --- the huntress _par excellence_. As soon as the Erinyes develop out of ghosts into avengers the element of pursuit comes in, they lose their double aspect and become all vindictive; they are no longer [GREEK] but [GREEK].

[GREEK] (_Eum._ 131).

In late vases which depict the scene of Orestes and the Erinyes, _e. g._ the krater of the Louvre (Baumeister, _Denkmäler_, 2. Fig. 1314) the dress of the Erinyes and that of Artemis is identical, save that Artemis carries her bow and quiver and two lances. This vase, it may be noted, is interesting also from the fact that one of the Erinyes is actually rising out of the ground, only visible from the breast upwards, just like the figure of Gaia. The final form of the Fury on Lower Italy Hades-vases is simply that of a malevolent Artemis.

The red-figured vase in Fig. 6 is of importance in respect to the question of art type. It is figured by Rosenberg (_Die Erinyen_, frontispiece) and interpreted by him as an Erinys. I incline to think, from the amplitude of the drapery, that the figure more likely represents a Maenad. The doubt is more instructive than any certainty. Maenads in mythology and Erinyes are only differentiations of the same fundamental idea. In fact the Maenads are Maniae, earth-born ministrants of Ge, and they hold her snakes, and like the Maniae in later days they are addressed as dogs.

I return to the snake-form. The snake-Erinys is only one aspect of a cultus of earth divinities once widespread in primitive Greece. Half a century ago Gerhard, with an insight extraordinary for his time, divined that practically nearly all the women goddesses of Greece are but modifications of one primitive goddess --- Mother Earth.* He says (_Über Metroon und Göttermutter_, 1849, p. 103): 'Nicht nur für Dia Dione, für Ilithyia und Theia, Themis und Artemis, Tyche und Praxidike, Chryse und Basileia, sondern auch für Demeter und Kora, Aphrodite und Hestia, Hera und Athene lässt, wenn wir nicht irren, diese Behauptung bis zu dem Grad sich durchführen, dass wir in allen diesen Götterinen nur wechselnde Namen und Auffassungen einer und desselben hellenisirten der Gäa gleichgeltenden Erd- und Schöpfungsgötten zu erkennen haben... Von überwiegendster Anwendung ist zur Seite der Göttermutter das Schlangen-symbol, es findet sich fast allen den Göttinen beigesellt die wir als örtlich wechselnde Ausdrücke jener ursprünglichen Göttereinheit erkannten, namentlich der thessalischen und italischen Here, der kekropischen Pallas, der eleusinischen Demeter.' It is strange that a conception so fertile, so illuminating, should have lain barren so long, obscured and paralysed by half a century of sun and moon myths. I only push Gerhard's argument a step further when I urge that the snake was not merely the symbol of the primitive earth daemon, but her actual supposed vehicle. Athene the maiden of Athens is but the anthropomorphised [GREEK] who dwelt beneath her shield, she is the [GREEK] of her city, and in the city's extremity she refuses to eat her honey-cake. Cecrops the serpent king is caught half-way in his transformation. We are so accustomed to the lifeless attributive snake of _e. g._ the chryselephantine Athene that we forget the live snake of the Acropolis. The design on a lekythos (Benndorf, _Gr. and Sic. Vas._ 51, 1; Roscher, _Lex._ 2. 979) recalls the live snake in drastic fashion. Kassandra takes refuge at the xoanon of Athene. Athene is represented in the usual (Promachos) fashion, on her shield a snake. But not only has she a painted snake on her shield, a great live snake --- a veritable Erinys --- darts forth from her altar with open jaws to attack Ajax. In like manner, when Philoctetes profanes the sanctuary of Chryse, the vase-painter (Baumeister, Fig. 1479) represents the snake that has bitten him returning complacently to the altar at the feet of the goddess. It is no accidental snake bite, it is the Erinys of the goddess --- _it is the goddess_ again, the [GREEK].

[GREEK]. (Soph. _Philoct._ 1325).

*) Since I wrote the above an interesting representation of the Earth Mother has come to  light at Zarkos (Thessaly). It is a female bust with long heavy hair, and the pedestal is inscribed [GREEK]. It is now in the museum at Constantinople. Joubin,
_Rev. Arch._ 34. 329, Pl. 12.

The two snakes who slew the sons of Laocoon were assuredly the Erinyes sent forth by Athene --- not originally by Apollo. When they had done their work they disappeared below the earth, [GREEK] (Q. Smyrn. 12, 480). They were important snakes with special names of their own, Porkis and Chariboia, as the scholiast on Lycophron tells us (_ad Alex._ 347). In like manner the snakes who attempt to slay the infant Heracles are the vehicles of Hera.

Again in the case of Demeter. She became so highly humanized that the snake at Eleusis is well nigh forgotten, at least as an object of cultus. But a ceremony in which the snake glided into the bosom of the initiated, was an integral part of the mysteries ([GREEK]).* On a Roman relief in the Uffizi (Overbeck, _Kunst. Myth._ Taf. 16. 2) near the figure of the seated Demeter a sekos is represented, from which emerges a huge snake, and on one of the Campana reliefs representing a cultus scene at Eleusis a worshipper is represented caressing the snake in the bosom of Demeter (_op. cit._ 16. 10). Of course, as anthropomorphism prevailed, the snake became merely the [GREEK] of the goddess. Strabo (393) says, [GREEK]. Aelian, in his _De Natura Animalium_ (11. 2), gives us an important, and, for our purpose, most interesting account of snake worship in Epirus. The passage is so instructive it must be cited in full. [GREEK]. Here we have a sacred snake, not slain as at Delphi, but taken on peaceably as the [GREEK] of Apollo. The snake has a maiden for a priestess, the omen is by food, as in the case of the [GREEK] of Athene Parthenos. Most interesting of all, for the moment, is the fact that the nation of Epirus recognized the kinship between their own sacred snake and that at Delphi. So that here we have suggested exactly what the argument most wants, _i. e._ the snake form of the Erinys, the earth goddess at Delphi. The truth has long been disguised by the fact, that, probably at the coming of Apollo, the Delphic snake changed from female to male, possibly that Apollo might have a foeman more 'worthy of his steel,' but the [GREEK], the ancient mantic serpent, Gaia's vehicle, would doubtless at the outset be female. The Homeric hymn (v. 300) has [GREEK], Euripides (_Iph. T._ 1245) has [GREEK]. The snake was doubtless, as in Epirus, the actual original oracle-giver, later it became merely the guardian. Apollodorus (1. 4, 1, 2) says, as [GREEK], and Pausanias (10. 6, 6) says of the Python [GREEK].
